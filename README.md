## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Creating a playbook that accomplished the following task: creating a Dockerfile that can be used to create a container image. A container created using the image should run the Tomcat Sample Application inside a Tomcat Application Server v9.0 and be able to serve the application on port 8080 under the following URL: http://localhost:8080/sample . An Ansible playbook should be used to build the container image from the Dockerfile and start a container using it. Additionally, the playbook should validate that the container was successfully created and is serving the sample application on the URL provided earlier using a Pytest (Python Testing Framework) script. The Ansible playbook should be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without failures. This playbook is build-and-run.yml .


All the necessary files for run the playbook are provided.

P.S.: Here you can find a ProofOfConcept using community.docker module also (WIP, not completed) : build-and-run-with-dockerSDK

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

It is assumed that Docker and python3 is installed in your system.

### Installing


If you need to configure python tools for this, you can use the bash script "create_virt_env.bash" to enable ansible, pytest and Docker SDK.

```
create_virt_env.bash
```


## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

The playbook will run them.


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
